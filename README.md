# Mask-Detection-Model-using-custom-Haarcascade
Face Mask Detection using a custom trained Haarcascade with various images with and without masks. The images used are real time images captured through my webcam for creating both the positove as well as negative classes. The Cascade Trainer GUI was used to train and create the Haarcascade File using a positive class of 200 Photos and Negative class of 400 photos. This is a very basic and simple model and cannot be used in major scale.

## Libraries Required
OpenCV 
Numpy

## Limitations 
The model was trained in very less data and therefore the model may not be able to generalize well. It is a just simple model just for explaining how you can train your model using custom Haarcascdes with minimal coding and effort. I'll be uploading another project on Mask Detecting using Deep Learning techniques which will be able to perform much better than a simple OpenCV model.
